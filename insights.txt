📌 Conclusions from the Biodiversity Dataset
From our Biodiversity Dashboard, we can derive key insights:

🔴 Top 10 Countries with Most Endangered Species

These countries have the highest number of endangered species, which suggests severe biodiversity loss.
Possible Causes: Habitat destruction, climate change, illegal poaching, deforestation.
🌍 Insight: Urgent conservation measures are needed in these regions.
🟡 Species Breakdown (Critical, Vulnerable, Endangered)

Some countries have more critically endangered species than others.
Others might have a large number of vulnerable species that could become endangered without intervention.
🌍 Insight: Countries with many vulnerable species could prevent them from becoming endangered if conservation actions are taken now.
🟢 Country-Wise Biodiversity Comparison

Some regions naturally have more species, while others have lost a significant number.
🌍 Insight: This helps determine which countries have been able to preserve biodiversity better.
