🌿 Biodiversity & Deforestation Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global biodiversity and deforestation data to understand the impact of forest loss on various species. Using datasets from Kaggle, we explore species distribution, conservation status, and forest cover changes through interactive visualizations in a Streamlit dashboard.

📜 Python Scripts

app.py - Main Streamlit application integrating biodiversity, deforestation, and comparison analysis.
biodiversity.py - Processes biodiversity data and generates visualizations.
deforestation.py - Analyzes deforestation trends and visualizes forest loss.
comparison.py - Compares biodiversity and deforestation trends, highlighting correlations.
clean_deforestation.py - Preprocessing script for cleaning and structuring deforestation data.
Bird_Cleaning-checkpoint.ipynb / Deforestation_Cleaning.ipynb - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.

📊 Datasets

final_biodiversity_dataset.csv - Processed dataset with global species distribution and conservation status.
cleaned_deforestation_dataset.csv - Cleaned deforestation dataset with forest area changes over time.
deforestation_data.csv - Raw deforestation dataset.
cleaned_biodiversity_dataset.csv - Intermediate cleaned dataset for biodiversity.

📄 Other Files

requirements.txt - Dependencies required to run the project.
.gitignore - Lists files and directories to be ignored in version control.

🔍 Key Insights

- Certain countries exhibit higher endangered species counts, correlating with high deforestation rates.
- Deforestation significantly impacts species diversity, particularly in regions with high biodiversity.
- Conservation efforts should prioritize high-risk areas identified in the analysis.

📌 Future Improvements

Update to a more recent biodiversity dataset.
Integrate machine learning models to predict future species threats.
Add more real-time data sources for up-to-date analysis.
